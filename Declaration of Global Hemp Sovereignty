# Declaration of Global Hemp Sovereignty
Ratified: December 2025 Location: The Policy Nexus Hub, Italiëlei 26 & The Global Distributed Ledger

### Preamble

Recognizing that the 21st century demands a radical reconciliation between human industry and the Earth’s biological systems, we, the members of the Global Hemp Nation, hereby assert our sovereign right to utilize Cannabis sativa L. as the foundational keystone for a harmonized climate. We declare that the tools of our survival—our data, our materials, and our economic structures—must be returned to the hands of the individuals and cooperatives that sustain them.


## Article I: The Right to Regenerative Resources

Every human being possesses the inalienable right to build, clothe, and sustain themselves using carbon-sequestering materials. We reclaim industrial hemp from the shadows of 20th-century prohibition, recognizing it not as a commodity, but as a Public Ecological Good.

The production of hempcrete, bioplastics, and bio-textiles shall be prioritized over petrochemical alternatives.
The blueprints for these technologies shall remain open-source and accessible through the Developer Hub.


## Article II: Sovereignty of the Human Imprint

We assert that an individual’s data is a biological extension of their personhood.

No entity shall harvest, trade, or monetize the environmental or personal data generated within this network without explicit, revocable consent via the Virtual Identity protocol.
The Global Hemp Ledger shall serve as the immutable record of our collective carbon sequestration, ensuring that the value created by the Earth is returned to its guardians.


## Article III: The Authority of the Cooperative

We reject the centralized, extractive models of the past. The Green Renaissance is powered by the Cooperative Data Server Network.

The means of production—from decortication plants to LFAM robotic 3D-printers—shall be owned and managed by the local cooperatives that operate them.
Economic value shall be measured by the Equity Index 2.0, prioritizing ecological health and wealth distribution over speculative growth.


## Article IV: The Mandate of Regenerative Intelligence

We commit to the stewardship of the planet through Regenerative Intelligence (RI).

Artificial intelligence within this network must be aligned with the Protagoras Principle: it shall serve to enhance human wisdom and ecosystem health, never to replace or exploit it.
The RI shall act as the nervous system of the Eco-Guardian Network, providing the bio-feedback necessary to heal the soil, water, and air of our shared home.


## Article V: Universal Access and the Policy Nexus

This declaration is a call to all nations and municipalities to recognize the Policy Nexus as a legitimate framework for governance.


We invite all citizens to host a node, plant a seed, and claim their place in the Global Hemp Fleet.
The landmarks of our movement, from Italiëlei 26 to the Galler, stand as physical embassies of this new era.


## Conclusion

“Man is the measure of all things.” By this declaration, we move from being observers of climate collapse to being architects of climate harmony. We stand united as a global cooperative, bound by the fiber of a single plant and the integrity of a shared digital ledger.

The Green Renaissance has begun.
